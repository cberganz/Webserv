## TCP socket programming
Socket : mechanism to give programs access to the network
- **create** a socket with `socket()`
- **identify** the socket with `bind()`
- **wait** for a connection with `listen()` and `accept()` 
- **send** and **receive** messages with `read()` and `write()` (or `send()` and `recv()`)
- **close** the socket with `close()`

There are some explanations about those functions in the following section.

## Authorized functions

### htons, htonl, ntohs, ntohl -- convert values between host and network byte order
```c++
#include <arpa/inet.h>
uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong);
uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort);
uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t netlong);
uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t netshort);
```
- `htons()` : converts a short integer (e.g. address) to a network representation 
- etc.

### epoll -- synchronous I/O multiplexing

`epoll()` is a method used to monitor several sockets. It waits for changing state or changing level for each socket monitored. `epoll()` can handle a lot of sockets descriptors. It contains a internal structure containing two lists :
- an interest list : which corresponds to all the file descriptors monitored
- a ready list which corresponds to the file descriptors ready for I/O

By default, `epoll()` is looking only at level changes.

#### epoll_create
```c++
int epoll_create(int nb);
```
creates a new `epoll` instance and returns a descriptor.

#### epoll_ctl
```c++
int epoll_ctl(int epfd, int op, int fd, struct epoll_event *event);
```
changes the behavior of our `epoll` instance.

- `epfd` is the descriptor of the `epoll` instance created
- `op` is the operation wanted on the epoll structure (for example add an new fd in the interest list, modify it or delete it)
- `fd` is the concerned descriptor
- `event` should be filled with the concerned `fd` and `flags` we want to apply on this `fd`

####  epoll_wait
```c++
int epoll_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents, int timeout);
```
waits for an event on any descriptor in the interest list.

- `epfd` is the descriptor of the `epoll` instance created
- `maxevents` is the maximum of events returned
- `events` is used to return information from the ready list

This function will block until :
- a file descriptor delivers an event
- the call is interrupted by a signal handler
- the timeout expires

### socket -- create a socket
```c++
#include <sys/socket.h>
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```
- return value : socket descriptor (like file descriptor)
- `domain` : specifies communication domain (local `AF_LOCAL`, through an internet protocol `AF_INET`, etc.)
- `type` : specifies the semantics of communication over the socket (`SOCK_STREAM`, `SOCK_DGRAM`, ...)
- `protocol` : specifies a protocol to use, it should be consistant with the `domain`, you can see protocol's values in `/etc/protocols`

### accept -- accept a connection on a socket
```c++
int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *restrict addr, socklen_t *restrict addrlen);
```
`accept` grabs the first connection request and create a new socket for communication (the listening socket should be used only for listening purpose). `addr` and `addrlen` are filled by the function.

### listen -- listen for connections on a socket
```c++
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
```
marks the socket `sockfd` as a listening socket. The `backlog` argument defines the maximum lenght of the queue of pending connection requests.

### send -- send a message on a socket
```c++
ssize_t send(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
```
The only difference between `write()` and `send()` is the presence of flags.

### recv -- receive a message from a socket
```c++
ssize_t recv(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
```
The only difference between `read()` and `recv()` is the presence of flags.

### bind -- identify a socket
Almost like assigning an address to a mailbox
```c++
int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len);
struct sockaddr_in 
{ 
    __uint8_t         sin_len; 
    sa_family_t       sin_family; 
    in_port_t         sin_port; 
    struct in_addr    sin_addr; 
    char              sin_zero[8]; 
};
```
with :
- `sin_family` = `domain`
- `sin_port` = a port number
- `sin_addr` = address for the socket (for example `inet_addr("127.0.0.1")` or const like `INADDR_ANY`)

### connect -- initiate a connection on a socket
```c++
int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```
Connects the socket `sockfd` to the address specified by `addr`.

### inet_addr -- IPv4 address manipulation

```c++
#include <arpa/inet.h>
in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);
```
converts the string `cp` to an integer value suitable for use as an Internet address.

### setsockopt -- set the socket 

```c++
int setsockopt(int sockfd, int level, int option_name, const void *option_value, socklen_t option_len);
```
sets the option `option_name` argument, at the protocol level specified by the `level` argument, to the value `option_value` for the socket `sockfd`.

### fcnt -- manipulate file descriptor

```c++
#include <fcntl.h>
int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ... /* arg */ );
```
performs one of the operation `cmd` on the open file descriptor `fd`.

## HTTP requests methods

HTTP defines a set of request methods(or *verbs*) to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.

The HTTP/1.0 specification defined the GET, HEAD, and POST methods, and the HTTP/1.1 specification added five new methods: PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE.

## HTTP Methods implemented

| MÃ©thode | Description                                                       |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET     | requests that the target resource transfer a representation of its state (**HTTP status codes**). Requests using GET should only retrieve data without making changes.        |
| POST    | submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. |
| DELETE  | deletes the specified resource.                                |

## HTTP/1.1 response
A response message is sent by a server to a client as a reply to its former request message. They define how information sent/received, the session verification and identification of the client (cookies, IP, user-agent) or their anonymity (VPN or proxy), how the server should handle data (Do-Not-Track)... 
```

Example of a complete configuration file (`nginx.conf` inspiration):
```
root ./app/demo;

server {
	listen 127.0.0.1:8080;
	client_max_body_size 2m;
	location / {
		autoindex on;
		allowed_methods GET POST DELETE;
		index galery.php;
		cgi on;
		upload_folder ./app/demo/files/;
	}

	location /set_cookies {
		cgi on;
		root ./app/demo/php_script;
		index set_cookies.php;
	}

	location /test {
		rewrite / 301;
	}
}
```

## CGI
CIG (Common Gateway Interface) enables web servers to execute an external program, for example to process user request.

Those programs requires additionnal informations (passed as environnement variables) to be executed. In return they provide all the informations needed by the server to respond to the client.

Our server should be able to specify which URLs should be handled by a specific CGI (cf `location *.php { cgi_pass CGI_PATH }` blocks).

As mentionned in the subject, we can fork to execute the CGI.
```
execve(CGI_PATH, args, env);
```
where `env` is filled as above.

Server specific variables :
- `SERVER_SOFTWARE` : name/version of HTTP server.
- `SERVER_NAME` : host name of the server, may be dot-decimal IP address.
- `GATEWAY_INTERFACE` : CGI/version.

Request specific variables :
- `SERVER_PROTOCOL` : HTTP/version.
- `SERVER_PORT` : TCP port (decimal).
- `REQUEST_METHOD` : name of HTTP method (see above)
- `PATH_INFO` : path suffix, if appended to URL after program name and a slash
- `PATH_TRANSLATED` : corresponding full path as supposed by server, if `PATH_INFO` is present.
- `SCRIPT_NAME` : relative path to the program, like `/cgi-bin/script.cgi`.
- `QUERY_STRING` : the part of URL after `?` character
- `REMOTE_HOST` : host name of the client, unset if server did not perform such lookup
- `REMOTE_ADDR` : IP address of the client (dot-decimal)
- `AUTH_TYPE` : identification type, if applicable
- `REMOTE_USER` : used for certain AUTH_TYPEs
- `REMOTE_IDENT` : see ident, only if server performed such lookup.
- `CONTENT_TYPE` : Internet media type of input data if `PUT` or `POST` method are used, as provided via HTTP header
- `CONTENT_LENGTH` : similarly, size of input data (decimal, in octets) if provided via HTTP header
- Variables passed by user agent (HTTP_ACCEPT, HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, HTTP_USER_AGENT, HTTP_COOKIE and possibly others) contain values of corresponding HTTP headers and therefore have the same sense.

Convention : we should have a `cgi-bin` directory in our root

Uploading files could be handled by CGI (for example php)
