-> Store parent context ptr inside ContextBase
-> Make keywords table a static private member of ParserConfig
-> Add a default value to directives in the keywords table
-> Is it possible to insert default blocs if they are mandatory but not present ?


ParserConfig:
- fonctions duplicates to find an index not a str
- method that checks if a keyword or index has a dfault (dfault.empty())
- method that checks if an index match a specific str
- methods to check if an str or an index is the end of the keywords table (so it does not exist inside it)

ContextBase:
- 

Context:

Errors handling:
ok - cannot have two identical location in the same bloc: nginx: [emerg] duplicate location "www/data" in /home/cberganz/ex.conf:8
- cannot have two server listening the same address. Or ignore it and take the first by default : nginx: [warn] conflicting server name "" on 0.0.0.0:80, ignored
- the context map should contain the ip and port or socket as key
- cannot have duplicate directives inside the same context (also for global context): nginx: [emerg] "root" directive is duplicate in /home/cberganz/ex.conf:10
- root should have a default value
